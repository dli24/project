#### Unsolved Problem
Since I have tried my best on creating this website, this website still have many bugs and problem that are difficult to solve on the limited time that this project need to be finished. 

 - Carousel Image- I have spend very long on modifying the images inside the Carousel that I have taken from BootStrap, but there are some stuff that I can or cannot modify from it. I cannot modify the image that have been pust inside the Carousel when I minimize the screen small from using Media Queries. There might be a way, but I have tried a long time which I run out of luck and ideas

 - required field for Email- I have encounter problems like there are required field for Name and Emails. If one of them are not filled, it will not submit and the border will turn red. But my code only work for the Name, not the email, or another way around is only email not the name if I change the code around. I will try to improve this in the future on my spare time.

#### Bigest Wins and Challenge. Deliverables

Creating the whole website are Challenging. Flexbox and Grid are very Challegening and it feel very good to overcome this challenge. I spend a lot of time to organize the flex box and at last, when I really overcome how this function, it really feels good! 

APIs- I have made an API google map on my page. The Map is not really difficult or challenging to put in the website, but as an backend lover, this accomplishment felt good also. Not a big challenge, but a huge satisfication.
